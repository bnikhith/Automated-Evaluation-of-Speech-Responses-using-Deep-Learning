# Automated-Evaluation-of-Speech-Responses-using-Deep-Learning
Our project centers on developing a deep learning model for automated grading of English text. We aim to address the time-intensive and highly subjective nature of manual grading—particularly in educational and language assessment contexts—by replacing it with an automated process. Leveraging advancements in deep learning models allows for more accurate and consistently repeatable assessments of English text.

Our methodology includes data collection, preprocessing, model development, training, and evaluation. Through extensive testing and validation, we will measure the model’s effectiveness based on grammar, coherence, and relevance. These findings will underscore the potential of automated grading to streamline assessments, save time, and provide immediate feedback to learners.

Moreover, this research has broad applicability across industries requiring automation in textual analysis, content moderation, and grammatical review. The model we propose paves the way for further innovations in automated language evaluation and text analysis, capitalizing on the capabilities of deep learning and NLP.
